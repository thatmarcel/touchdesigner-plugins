## Plugins
### Lasercube
A plugin that allows you to control a Lasercube via Wifi.
It takes the output of a Laser CHOP as the input.

Make sure the sample rate of the Laser CHOP is equal to the Lasercube CHOP's and that it doesn't exceed the device's max sample rate.

This plugin is still in development. You may experience visual glitches or disconnects.
